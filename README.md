## 1. ABOUT THE PROJECT:
It’s a free – track robot that has the following features: obstacle avoidance via ultrasonic sensor, metal detecting via a metal detector sensor (MDS-60).

If it’s metal, the buzzer will ring, the robot will stop moving.

In case of obstacle detected, the robot will rotate to the right until the path is clear.

## 2. HARDWARE COMPONENTS:
>> ATMEGA32 microcontroller
>> Metal Detector MDS-60
>> Ultrasonic Sensor HC–04 
>> DC Motors
>> L298N DC Motor Driver H–Bridge  
>> Li–ion Battery (3.7V, 2400mAh)
